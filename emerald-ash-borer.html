<h2><u>Emerald Ash Borer</u></h2>
<p>Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis), or EAB as itâ€™s commonly known, is a small, metallic-green, invasive wood-boring beetle native to east Asia that attacks and kills ash trees (fraxinus spp.). Adult beetles live on the outside of trees and feed on the leaves during the summer months, while the larvae feed on the living plant tissue, the phloem and cambium, underneath the bark. The tunneling and feeding activity of the larvae is what ultimately kills trees. EAB attacks trees of any size, age, or stage of health, and trees can die within two years of infestation.</p>
<p>The spread of EAB into uninfected areas has been done primarily through the movement of firewood. Iowa is currently under federal firewood transport quarantine, which means that, although it is not illegal to transport firewood within the state or into other quarantined states, it is strongly recommended that firewood only be obtained from within the county where it will be burned. </p>
